# Stellar Blockchain

[Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/) is the blockchain technology we use for our ThreeFold_Token.

ThreeFold integrated with Stellar to use [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/) blockchain as a payment layer for ThreeFold Grid. 

Stellar is an efficient payment-oriented blockchains. It is fast, secure and has low transaction fees. 

Unlike many other blockchains, Stellar does not try to serve all possible needs. Stellar is first of all greatly engineered payment blockchain. 
Moreover, stellar has native built-in decentralised exchange. Considering already developed stellar ecosystem, ThreeFold Token can also enjoy [multiple existing wallets](threefold_wallets) that support stellar tokens. 


## Future

We are in the process of expanding the reach of our token to multiple blockchains e.g. the Polkadot ecosystem. Information coming soon.
